## 💡 How to Use the Data

### In Components

```typescript
// Import college data
import { collegeInfo, departments, placements } from '@/lib/collegeData'

// Use in component
const collegeName = collegeInfo.name
const deptCount = departments.length
const placementRate = placements.averagePlacementRate

// Access specific department
const cse = departments.find(d => d.code === 'CS')
const labs = cse?.laboratories
```

### For API Integration

All data structures are ready for backend API integration:
- Replace hardcoded data with API calls
- Use existing `apiClient` in `lib/api.ts`
- Maintain same data structure for easy replacement
